# TODO list for MCMCglmm branch?

 * Allow MCMCglmm outputs as inputs for `make.dispRity`
 * Allow for a new function called `MCMCglmm.subsets` that makes groups based on a `MCMCglmm` object (by default, all posteriors becomes a group?), the data is then a big set of matrices where the columns are the VCVs and the rows are the groups?

 - [ ] change `MCMCglmm.subsets` to `MCMCglmm.dispRity`. BUT IMPLEMENT IN BEER FIRST!


 1 - get.covar
 2. new metrics: ellipse? axes?
